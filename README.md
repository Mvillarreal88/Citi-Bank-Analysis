### Citi Bike Analysis:

We start by looking into the Citi Bank Bike data for the last 6 months and what phenomenoms we can witness.

### Phenomenon’s:

• The first phenomenom we notice is that alot of the most popular stations are all near the bay.
- One thing we may want to do is increase is the amount service areas for the bikes in the bay areas.

• From June on we also notice a rapid decline in number of people who are using the Docked bikes, we may be able to limit the service of these vehicles by limiting the number of these bikes available.
- Leading into the Fall we can really save some money in relation to the Docked bikes. We can see that the classic bikes are having a sharp increase in popularity, but opposite in docked. So if we shift the focus to removing the availability of docked bikes and focus more on the classic leading into fall we can save money.
